# Data-for-FCNFP
There is a dataset of the FCNF problem.

For each instance, the data consist of two files: ``A_bar_x.txt'' and ``uuf_x.txt, where the ``x'' in filename represents the item of this instance. 
In file ``A_bar_x.txt'', there is a matrix with size $(n,m+1)$, which is splicing by matrix $A$ and vector $b$ in FCNF Problems. 
In file ``uuf x.txt'', there is a matrix with size $(3,m)$, which is splicing by vectors $u$, $c$, and $s$. 
Because of space limitation, I only upload partly txt files here. If you need the remaining instances with large scale or the npy files, please contact me by the email: yl0501@mail.ustc.edu.cn
